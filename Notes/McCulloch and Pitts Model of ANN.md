**McCulloch and Pitts Model of ANN**
--
In 1943 McCulloch and Pitts invented this most fundamental artificial neuron / perceptron. It is same as biological neuron. It is also known as linear threshold gate.

Here *l1.....ln* is the number of input.  *w1......wn* are weight values normalized in the range of either *(0,1) or (-1,1)* and associated with each input. The whole point is sum the inputs. 
If the sum is greater than *T* then output is *1*. and if sum is less than or equal to *T* then output is *0*. 
where *T* is the threshold constant which is a linear step function.

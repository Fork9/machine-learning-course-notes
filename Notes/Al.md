**Perceptron**
> Like biological brain, ANNN are also made of an inter-connected individual neuron call perceptron. 
> perceptron adds up all the input based on their weight and feed them to an activation function which results the output of the perceptron. 

**Deep Learning**
> Deep learning uses neural network with multiple neural network. 

**Machie Learning**
> ML is a set of mathmetical algorithm for automatic date analysis.

**What is Linear Regression?** 

>Regression searches for relationships among variables.

For example, you can observe several employees of some company and try to understand how their **salaries** (*response / dependent variable / outputs*) depend on the features, such as **experience**, **level of education**, **role**, **city** *(predictor / independent variable / inputs)* they work in, and so on.


**Why we need Regression ?**
> Regression typically used to check how several variables are related.

**Regression formula :**

We will learn to use Linear Regression by using **Least Square Method**

**What is Least Square Method ?**
>The least squares method is a statistical procedure to find the best fit for a set of data points by minimizing the sum of the offsets or residuals of points from the plotted curve. Least squares regression is used to predict the behavior of dependent variables

**Formula for Multiple Linear Regression**

**What is residuals point ?**
> Residuals points is the difference between predicted response and actual response. Regression is about determining the smallest residuals.
